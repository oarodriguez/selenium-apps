# python-project

A template for your Python project. It uses Poetry as a dependency manager and
Apache 2.0 as its license.

## Installation of dependencies

Dependencies are managed by [poetry][poetry], so poetry should be installed
in the system. In the project root directory,  execute

```shell
poetry install
```

Poetry will take care of the installation process. Afterward, the project
packages and command-line interface tools should be available in the current
shell. It is recommended to create a separate virtual environment for this
project.
